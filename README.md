#Project-NinjaFrog is a 2D PIXEL GAME called Frog Ninja. 

In this game, players control the Frog Ninja through various levels, and to overcome challenges. 
The development process posed interesting challenges, such as perfecting sprite animations and refining level design. 
My primary goal was to deepen my understanding of game development in Unity, focusing on scripting and player mechanics.
